# Cooking LDA With Recipes
## Description
In the thematic modeling, it is assumed that the order of words in the document is not important for determining the subject (“bag of words” hypothesis). We will work with a somewhat non-standard for thematic modeling collection, which can be called the “bag of ingredients”, because it consists of recipes from different cuisines. Thematic models are looking for words that are often found together in documents and make up topics. We will try to apply this idea to recipes and find culinary “themes”. This collection is good because it doesn't require preprocessing. In addition, it illustrates the principle of thematic models quite clearly.

__What are we going to do:__
* view data;
* build lda models;
* experiment with model parameters and analyze results;
* find culinary "themes";
* generate the unique recipe :)

## Description of folders
* **data**: contains recipe descriptions;
* **model**: contains notebook with analysis.
